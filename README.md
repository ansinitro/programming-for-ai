# Programming for Artificial Intelligence

## üéØ Course Overview
**Programming for AI** provides a foundation in programming principles, tools, and frameworks essential for developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications.  
Students will learn to design, implement, and test AI-related programs using **Python**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, and **TensorFlow**.  

This course bridges theory and practice ‚Äî helping students gain both algorithmic understanding and hands-on experience in working with real-world datasets, building machine learning models, and managing AI development workflows.

## üß† Learning Objectives
By completing this course, you will learn to:
- Use key tools for AI development ‚Äî Python, Git/GitHub, Jupyter/Colab, and cloud environments.  
- Create and manipulate data structures, apply OOP principles, and write modular, reusable code.  
- Read and write datasets in formats like CSV, JSON, and TXT, including working with APIs and large data files.  
- Apply **NumPy** and **tensor operations** for mathematical tasks such as linear algebra and random sampling.  
- Load, clean, and preprocess datasets for machine learning experiments.  
- Apply **text preprocessing** and **NLP techniques** (tokenization, TF-IDF, embeddings).  
- Visualize data and models using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **TensorBoard**.  
- Implement machine learning models (classification, regression, clustering) using **Scikit-learn**.  
- Design and train **neural networks** (MLP, CNN) using **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**.
