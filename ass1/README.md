# Assignment 1 ‚Äî Working with Directories and Files in Python  

## üìù Task 1 (25 points) ‚Äî Working with Folders and Files

### 1. Creating Project Structure
Write a Python script that creates the following project directory:
```

project/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ results/

```

### 2. Working with CSV Files
- In the `data` folder, create a file `students.csv` containing students‚Äô data:
  - Full name  
  - Group  
  - Grades  
- Read the file and calculate the **average score** for each student.

### 3. Save Results
- Save aggregated results in JSON format:  
  `results/report.json`
- If the file already exists ‚Äî show a **warning** and ask for confirmation before overwriting.

### 4. Archiving
- Automatically create an archive `results.zip` that includes the `results` folder.

### 5. Working with `pathlib`
- Implement a check to see if `report.json` exists.  
  If it does, print its **file size** and **last modification date**.

## üìù Task 2 (25 points) ‚Äî Search for a Word in Text Files

- Generate **5 text files** (e.g., `name_1.txt`, `name_2.txt`, ‚Ä¶) in one folder.  
- Each file contains arbitrary text.  
- Write a program that:
  - Accepts a **search query** (single word or phrase).
  - Outputs the **names of files** that contain the substring.
  - If no matches found ‚Äî display an appropriate message.

**Input example:**
```

probability theory

```

**Output example:**
```

Found in: file2.txt, file4.txt

```

## üìù Task 3 (25 points) ‚Äî File Information

Given a text file `file.txt`, write a program that outputs:

- Number of Latin letters  
- Number of words  
- Number of lines

## üìù Task 4 (25 points) ‚Äî Replacing Forbidden Words

Files provided:
- `words.txt`
- `forbidden_words.txt`

In `forbidden_words.txt`, forbidden words are separated by spaces.

Write a program that:
- Replaces **all forbidden words** in `words.txt` with `*` (asterisks).
- The number of `*` equals the number of letters in the forbidden word.
- Replacement is **case-insensitive** and applies even inside other words.

**Example:**
If `exam` is forbidden, then:
```

exam, Exam, EXAM ‚Üí ****

```

**Output format:**  
Edited text according to the task condition.
